# Getting Started with Marmistonks

This project is a lame (and very elementary) clone of the famous french recipe website "Marmiton"
I only made it for ReactJS training purpose and it covers the use of TypeScript, Firebase and NextJS

## Available Scripts


This is a NextJs application, so, in order to test it trough your browser, once you are inside the application directory, you must run :

### `npm install`


to install the app, and then :


### `npm run dev`



It will run the app in development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser.

The page will reload if you make edits.\
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

Have fun !
